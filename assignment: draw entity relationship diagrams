Problem 1: A space agency wants to develop a database of all satellites that humans have launched into space. Data includes the satellite identification, date of launch, destruction date, purpose, maximum orbital altitude, launching location, launching agency, and contact information for agency. 

Problem 2: A psychological study requires participants to answer a number of questions related to personality. The database should store the multiple choice answers (A, B, C, D) to the questions and information about each participant, such as participant id, age, and sex. The database should compute a score based on the individual's answers. The score indicates one of 8 personality categories. Each category has an identifying name and specifies that each of three qualities is either true or false.
